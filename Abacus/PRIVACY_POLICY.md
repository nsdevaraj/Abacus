# Privacy Policy for Abacus

**Last Updated: February 23, 2026**

## Overview

Abacus ("we," "our," or "the app") is committed to protecting the privacy of our users, especially children. This Privacy Policy explains how the app handles information.

## Information Collection

**We do NOT collect, transmit, or share any personal information.**

Abacus is designed with privacy as a core principle:
- **No account creation** - The app does not require users to create accounts or provide personal information
- **No data transmission** - All data stays on your device and is never sent to external servers
- **No tracking** - We do not track user behavior or collect analytics
- **No third-party services** - We do not integrate any third-party tracking, advertising, or analytics services

## Data Storage

All information is stored **locally on your device** using Apple's CoreData framework:

### What is Stored Locally:
- Problem completion records (which problems were completed and when)
- Daily practice statistics (number of problems completed per day)
- Game progress (which islands and stages have been accessed)
- Correctness tracking (whether problems were answered correctly)

### How Data is Used:
This local data is used solely to:
- Display your progress in the 5×5 problem grids
- Show completion dates in dd/MM format
- Track daily practice patterns in the calendar view
- Determine which problem to present next during gameplay
- Provide visual indicators of achievement

### Data Control:
- All data remains on your device
- Data is not backed up to iCloud (unless device backup settings include app data)
- Deleting the app removes all stored data permanently
- You can reset progress by deleting and reinstalling the app

## Children's Privacy

Abacus is designed for use by children and fully complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).

- We do **NOT** collect personal information from children
- We do **NOT** allow children to share personal information

## Third-Party Access

We do **NOT**:

## Data Security

- We use Apple's secure CoreData framework for local storage
- No network transmission means no risk of interception
- Data is protected by iOS/iPadOS security measures
